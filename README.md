# TÃ¤htituho shader-system
Attempt to create simple shader demo system with support for rocket and png textures. 

# Requirements
glfw, rocket, jsoncpp, bass, glew, lodepng and glText are included in project.

- glfw version 3.3.3 https://www.glfw.org/
- rocket https://github.com/emoon/rocket
- jsoncpp version 0.10.7 https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp
- bass version 2.4.13.8 http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html
- glew version 2.2.0 http://glew.sourceforge.net/
- lodepng https://lodev.org/lodepng/
- glText https://github.com/vallentin/glText


C++ compiler is needed, and on linux g++ can found easily from package management, but on windows mingw or mingw-64 works well. Remember to choose 32bit.
- http://www.mingw.org/
- http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php
 
Make sure that miDebuggerPath is correct in `lauch.json`. Check `c_cpp_configuration.json` that compilerPath is correct as well, to ensure that intellisense is working correctly. **NOTE** do not commit those changes to repository, as they are specific to your system.

At least these packages are needed for MinGW from Basic Setup
- mingw32-base-bin
- mingw32-gcc-g++-bin
- msys-base-bin
- mingw32-libmingwex-dev
- mingw32-libmingwex-dll

CMake is needed. Download it from https://cmake.org/ and install **CMake Tools** extension for Visual Studio Code
# Notes on compiling
### Windows/Linux
Create output folder for executable(ie. bin/debug) as compiler cannot create folders by itself.

### Windows
Make sure that mingw is available, easy way to handle this is to add mingw folder (e.g. "C:\MinGW\bin") to PATH variable
Make sure that .vscode/settings.json has `"C_Cpp.intelliSenseEngine": "Tag Parser"`

### Linux
Use following command to install required libraries
`sudo apt-get install g++-multilib libglew-dev xorg-dev`

### Compiling
Use command *CMake: Configure* to create configuration. Configuration will appear in **build** folder. Use command *CMake: Build* to compile shader system. 

### Debugging
Press F5 to start debug.

# executing
To run shader-system in release mode execute following steps. Release mode means mode where you write shader code, sync graphics with music and present your demo at party.
1. Make directory where you want to store shader-system.
1. Build relese version.
1. Copy bass.dl from libs/bass-24-win/ to newly created folder
1. Copy glew32.dl from libs/glew-2.2.0/bin/Release to newly created folder
1. Copy glfw3.dll from /build/libs/glfw-3.3.3/src to newly created folder

When demo system is executed without parameters, it defaults configuration file to "configuration.json".

Be sure that shaders, music and textures defined in "configuration.json" exist, as shader system does not give any error messages is some files are missing.

1. start rocket client
2. start "ShaderSystem.exe"
Tracks defined in "configuration.json" will appear on rocket. Open fragment shader defined in "configuration.json" and verify that uniform variables corresponding to rocket tracks are present. When changes have been made to fragment shader press "r" to reload shader. Press "s" to turn tune on or off.
